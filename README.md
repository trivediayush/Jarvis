# Jarvis - Virtual Assistant

This is a Python-based virtual assistant named Jarvis, which can perform a variety of tasks such as opening websites, playing music, and processing commands via voice recognition. It uses several libraries, including `speech_recognition`, `pyttsx3`, `pygame`, and `OpenAI` API, to function like a personal assistant.

## Features

- Voice command recognition with `speech_recognition`.
- Text-to-speech responses with `gTTS` and `pygame`.
- Integration with OpenAI's GPT-3.5 for processing commands.
- Ability to open popular websites like Google, Facebook, YouTube, etc.
- Can play music from a predefined music library.

## Requirements

Before running this program, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- `speech_recognition`
- `pyttsx3`
- `gTTS`
- `pygame`
- `openai`
- `musicLibrary` (custom module or replace with your own music library)

You can install the necessary libraries using the following:

```bash
pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3 gTTS pygame openai
```
Music Library
You'll need a custom musicLibrary.py file that stores the music links for different songs. Here's an example format for the musicLibrary.py:

python
Copy code
music = {
    "song_name": "song_url"
}
## How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Set up the OpenAI API key in the code.
3. Install the required libraries (listed above).
4. Run the program:
```bash
python main.py
```
## How to Use
1. Run the program and it will initialize with a voice prompt saying "Initializing Jarvis....".
2. Once the assistant is active, you can say "Jarvis" to wake it up.
3. After saying "Jarvis", you can issue commands like:
"Open Google"
"Open YouTube"
"Play [song_name]"
Jarvis will then perform the requested task, such as opening a website or playing music.
